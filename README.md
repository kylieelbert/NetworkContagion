# Replication of "The Hidden Geometry of Network-Driven Contagion Phenomena"  
*by Dirk Helbing and Dirk Brockmann*

This repository contains the implementation and results of replicating the findings from the paper **"The Hidden Geometry of Network-Driven Contagion Phenomena"** by Dirk Helbing and Dirk Brockmann. The paper explores the dynamics of contagion processes across complex networks, with a focus on understanding how network structure influences the spread of contagions (e.g., diseases, information, or behaviors).

## Project Overview  
In this project, we replicate key experiments and findings from the paper, using network-driven contagion models and data analysis. The objective is to understand the relationship between network topologies and the spread of contagions, including how different structures affect the speed and reach of contagion.

**Note:** The Python file containing the actual contagion simulation was too large to upload directly to the repo. However you can access it via the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i4jYmRPUGTnCD6OWiKSvo83HBcrtwF9_/view?usp=share_link 

## Key Elements of the Project:
- **Network Construction**: We create a Global Mobility Network based on the paper's description.
- **Contagion Simulation**: We implement contagion models based on the paperâ€™s descriptions, where nodes in the network represent individuals or entities, and edges represent interactions or relationships.
- **Data Analysis**: We analyze the spread of contagions across these networks and compare our results with those presented in the original paper.
